            <h2><em>Formation of the band</em></h2>
            <p>In March 1956, John Lennon, aged 16, and a few of his friends from school played in a skiffle band called the Quarrymen...</p>
            <p>After meeting John in the July of that year, Paul McCartney joined the band as a rhythm guitarist and invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band perform. George then auditioned to be in the band, but John thought that he was too young. However, after several months of persistence, he performed lead guitar in a performance and was enlisted as their lead guitarist.</p>
            <p >On 11th February 1963, The Beatles recorded ten songs during a single studio session for their debut album, <em>Please Please Me</em>. After the positive reaction to their first single <em>Love Me Do</em>, the single <em>Please Please Me</em> was met with an even bigger reaction, and it reached number one on every UK chart except Record Retailer, where it reached number two.</p>
